# space trading game
A space trading game based in python. The game is designed around a server/client relationship. 

Plenty of things to see, the main game file is named space_game.py This game will be used by students to learn OOP and how to program. 
It is part of a high school computing course. I'd say the game is about 15% done, with really important bits left to fill out. 

Please, please feel free to contribute anything you'd like.
